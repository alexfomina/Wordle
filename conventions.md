# Naming Conventions:
Packages: Lowercase with dots (e.g., com.example.myproject)
Classes, enums, interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., MyClass, SomeEnum)
Methods and fields: camelCase (e.g., calculateArea, userName)
Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_VALUE, PI)
Indentation and Whitespace:

Use consistent indentation, typically 4 spaces per level.
Surround operators with spaces (e.g., x = y + 1).
Separate statements with a space or newline.
Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.
Formatting:

Limit line length to around 80 characters.
Use curly braces for all code blocks, even single-line ones.
Consistent use of single or double quotes for strings.
Commenting:

Use clear and concise comments to explain non-obvious code.
Include comments for class, method, and non-trivial code blocks.
Use Javadoc comments for public classes and methods.
Programming Practices:

Don't make instance or class variables public unless necessary.
Avoid using an object to access static variables or methods.
Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose.
Use meaningful constants instead of literal values (except common ones like 0, 1, -1).
Be liberal with parentheses in expressions to improve readability.
