Classes, enums, interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., MyClass, SomeEnum)
Methods and fields: camelCase (e.g., calculateArea, userName)
Constants: UPPERCASE_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., MAX_VALUE, PI)

### Indentation and Whitespace:
Use consistent indentation, typically 4 spaces per level.
Surround operators with spaces (e.g., x = y + 1).
Separate statements with a newline.
Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code.

### Formatting:
Limit line length to around 80 characters.
Use curly braces for all code blocks, even single-line ones.
Consistent use of single or double quotes for strings.
Commenting:

### Documentation
Use clear and concise comments to explain non-obvious code.
Include comments for class, method, and non-trivial code blocks.
Use Javadoc comments for public classes and methods.
Programming Practices:

### Miscellaneous
Don't make instance or class variables public unless necessary.
Avoid using an object to access static variables or methods.
Use variable names that reflect their purpose.
Be careful with nesting to improve readability.
